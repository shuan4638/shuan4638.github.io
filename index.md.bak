I am Shuan Chen from Taipei, Taiwan, and I am currently a PhD student and guitar teacher in KAIST, South Korea. My ultmate goal of research is to develop green chemistry and sustainable energy for a better world.

I did my master program with Professor Hyn Uk Kim at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), [SBML](https://sbml.kaist.ac.kr/) working on projects about Drug-Drug Interaction prediction and oriental medicine using deep learning. Here are the projects that I participated in:
1. [Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction by Deep Learning](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/E4304)

Currently I am doing PhD program at KAIST, Advanced Material Simulation Group ([AMSG](http://qchem.kaist.ac.kr/home/)) with Professor Yousung Jung to devise an AI-assisted chemical synthesis planning model **LocalRetro** and reaction prediction model **LocalTransform**.
1. [Deep Retrosynthetic Reaction Prediction using Local Reactivity and Global Attention](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacsau.1c00246)
